## sqlmap POST request injection
- - - Usage:

- Put the files `SPRI.py` and `request.txt` into your parent directory of `sqlmap` that's it.

- Change the content of `request.txt` with yours =)

* * * * You can get your `POST` request info by using some of the scanners, `OWASP`, `Burp Suite`, and more...

## Good luck ;)
